# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# Ignore ruby_mine folder
/.idea

# Symbol tags (e.g. generated by Atom Editor)
/tags

*~
.DS_Store
.svn
.*.swp
___*

# Ignore bundler config.
/.bundle

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
/log/*
!/log/.keep
/tmp

# Ruby debugger related files
.byebug_history

# Ruby version file
# Ignored so anyone using this project can use their version of preference
.ruby-version

# Ignore the cookies.txt file created if curl examples are used when in the
# project's root folder
cookies.txt
