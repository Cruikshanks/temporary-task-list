# Temporary task list

This is not intended for actual use. It is a task list creator which only lives as long as your session! It is  intended to serve as a base app for tutorials, particularly on how to use [Git](https://git-scm.com/).

It is built using Ruby and makes use of the [Sinatra](https://github.com/sinatra/sinatra) gem.

## Pre-requisites

You'll need [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) installed (ideally the latest version available) plus the [Bundler](http://bundler.io/) gem.

## Installation

Clone the repository, copying the project into a working directory

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Cruikshanks/temporary-task-list.git
cd temporary-task-list
```

Then run the following command

```bash
bundle install
```

[Bundler](http://bundler.io/) will download everything needed for the project. Once complete you're good to go!

## Execution
